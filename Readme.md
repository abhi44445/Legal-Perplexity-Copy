## Environment Setup

### Using Pipenv
Pipenv is a tool that manages dependencies and virtual environments for Python projects.

1. Install Pipenv if you don't have it:
    ```
    pip install pipenv
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:
    ```
    pipenv install
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```
    pipenv shell
    ```

4. (Optional) Install any additional dependencies:
    ```
    pipenv install <package_name>
    ```

---

### Using Conda
Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system.

1. Create a new conda environment:
    ```
    conda create -n myenv python=3.9
    ```

2. Activate the environment:
    ```
    conda activate myenv
    ```

3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (if available):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

### Using Pip
Pip is the standard package installer for Python.

1. Install virtualenv if you don't have it:
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```
    virtualenv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (if available):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project

### Modern FastAPI + React Application (Recommended)

The main application runs as a modern web service with separate backend and frontend:

#### Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements-fastapi.txt

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

#### Frontend (React + Vite)
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

#### Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5174
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Constitution Chat**: http://localhost:5174/chat
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

---

## Legacy Phase-based Execution

The project consists of three Python files, each corresponding to a different phase of the project:

### To run the App directly
```
streamlit run main.py
```

### To run app in different phases

1. Phase 1: Run the first phase using:
    ```
    streamlit run frontend.py
    ```

2. Phase 2: Run the second phase using:
    ```
    python vector_database.py
    ```

3. Phase 3: Run the third phase using:
    ```
    python rag_pipeline.py
    ```

Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
